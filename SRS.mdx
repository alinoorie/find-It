# FindIt - A university-centric lost and found progressive web application

## 1. Introduction

Lovely Professional University is one of India's largest campus univeristies, spanning across 600 acres of land with 30,000+ students, 2000+ faculty members, and 100+ departments. The university has a huge campus with multiple buildings, and it is not physically possible for the university administration to keep track of all the items that are lost on campus. This is where our application comes in. Our application will be a university-centric lost and found progressive web application. This means that users will have to use their university email id to create an account. This will ensure that only students of the university can use the application. The application will also have a feature where users can report lost items to the university administration. This will help the university administration to keep track of the items that are lost on campus.
